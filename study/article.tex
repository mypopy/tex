\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
This is my \emph{first} document prepared in \LaTeX. I typed it on \today.

We have seen that to typeset something in \LaTeX, we type in the
text to be typeset together with some \LaTeX commands.
Words must be separated by spaces (does not matter how many)
and lines maybe broken arbitrarily.

The end of a paragraph is secified by a \emph{blank line}
in the input. In other worss, whenever you want to start a new
paragraph, just leave a blank line and proceed.
\end{document}
